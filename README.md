# Sophist

Sophist is a sophisticated theme for blogs. Sophist attempts to imitate the
feel of high-quality, professionally-typeset letters. Combining a devotion to
minimal negative space and the finest open-source seriffed fonts from Google
creates a highly lightweight theme that is perfect for bloggers who want to
maintain a visually-pleasing aesthetic without serving bandwidth-intensive JS
or CSS frameworks.

## Features

- No CSS frameworks (Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.)
- Purely text-based
- Very fast to build and cheap to serve
- Ships with assets included (no references to CDNs)

## Installation

Read documentation from [Hugo's
website](https://gohugobrasil.netlify.app/themes/installing-and-using-themes/)
to learn how to install and use Hugo themes.

## Configuration

For most blogs, configuration should not be needed for this theme. Simply
update your `hugo.toml` file to configure your site as usual.
